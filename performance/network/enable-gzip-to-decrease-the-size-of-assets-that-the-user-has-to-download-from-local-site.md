The Gzip compression technology used for web pages makes it possible to **reduce the size of a typical web file to about 70%** or less of its original size before it gets sent to this visitor. This compressed file is served to the browser of your visitor which then decompresses it automatically whereafter it serves the full file to your visitor. Enabling Gzip compression is great for speed because the browser of your visitor needs to download much smaller files when browsing your web pages. Thereâ€™s no reason to not use it these days, every self respecting website owner should use it for their websites.

# How do I fix this ?

Enable Gzip compression for all non-compressed resource types. Don't compress jpeg images, for example, as these are already compressed and gzipping will only add overhead.
