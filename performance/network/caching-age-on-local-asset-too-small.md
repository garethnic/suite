Having an extremely short caching age on local resources (in production) is generally a bad idea, as this nullifies the point of allowing the browser to cache resources.

# How do I fix this ?

Consider setting the expires header at least two days in the future. If this is unacceptable, alternatives include filename based cache busting or adding query strings to the end of resources (this can be automated).
