Caching allows the user's browser to keep a local copy of a resource for fast loading without downloading the entire resource from the server every time.

This issue refers to a external resource that does not have caching headers defined which makes caching on the users' browser unpredictable.

# How do I fix this ?

We advise contacting the remote vendor and showing them the information as to the benifits that will be gained by having complete control of how long a resource is cached at [passmarked.com/performance/inspect/missing-cache-headers-on-local-asset](http://passmarked.com/performance/inspect/missing-cache-headers-on-local-asset) which will also guide as to how this can be enabled.
