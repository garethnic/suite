GZIP is used to compress text based responses before sending them to the client who will uncompress them.

This allows clients to download a considerable smaller file by taking a small expense of compressing on the server when sending the response.

By general GZIP can save your users 80%+ on file sizes to download, in most cases.

This issue is related to a external asset that was used which does not have GZIP enabled and could save your users a minimum 20kb or more from the size of files needed to download to display your page.

We advice contacting the remote vendor and showing the information as to the benifits that will be gained by enabling GZIP at [passmarked.com/performance/inspect/enable-gzip-to-decrease-size-that-the-user-has-to-download-from-local-site](http://passmarked.com/performance/inspect/enable-gzip-to-decrease-size-that-the-user-has-to-download-from-local-site) which will also guide as to how this can be enabled.

Else others that have GZIP enabled with the same content could also be sourced.
