Expired certificates are invalid. Browsers will show a strong warning message to visitors, and you won't be able to send encrypted traffic via your servers.

# How do I fix this ?

Renew your certificate with your Certification Authority as soon as possible â€” most CA's allow renewal up to 30 days after expiry. In the future, make sure to renew your certificate at least a month **before** expiry.
