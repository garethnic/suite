Having broken links in your page content may affect your search engine ranking and leave your users with a negative experience if it's a regular occurrence.

# How do I fix this ?

* Add relevant content to those URL's if possible.
* Use a free/paid link scanner to help find broken links.
* Use [Google Webmaster Tools](http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/) to find and remove bad URL's.
* Make sure broken links return with 404 a response code to avoid being indexed.
* Create a custom 404 page with the same look and feel as your site, include navigational links.
* Redirect to relevant pages using `301: Moved Permanently` response code to automatically refer browsers and crawlers to the new location.
