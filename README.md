# Passmarked README Specs

![Passmarked Text Logo](http://static.passmarked.com/text64.png)

Community descriptions of the specs for use on [passmarked.com](http://passmarked.com) to describe and provide descriptions for each of our tests.

These contents are made public with the intent for the community at large to use and help improve. 

Our system pulls from the **#master** branch to display the information when we show results to help users fix any issues we may have found on their websites.

# Contribute

We love contributions !

Read about our file structure and view a few **pull-requests** to get a sense of our community. Then fork and make changes to improve the documentation, we'll review any **pull-request** and merge making it live on [passmarked.com](http://passmarked.com) to help users fix issues on their websites !

We have a active team on **#Slack** for discussions, login on [passmarked.com](http://passmarked.com) to help us decide on rule importance and receive a invite.

# File Structure

**Passmarked** allows browsing and viewing rules that shows users issues and how to fix them.

Each of these issues we look for are defined as a **rule** that are grouped into a **test** that groups related **rules**.

For easier navigation each of the tests are grouped into **categories** which groups **tests** based on what is checked.

The contents for each of these pages are added to folders in this repo based on the following structure:

## {category}/readme.md

Overall description to what is checked in the category. This is aimed to provide general overview at to what the users can expect for any tests listed in the category.

Example [compatibility/readme.md](https://github.com/passmarked/suite/blob/master/compatibility/readme.md)

## {category}/{test}/readme.md

General description of the goals for the test and examples of why it's necessary to check for these issues.

Example [compatibility/html/readme.md](https://github.com/passmarked/suite/blob/master/compatibility/html/readme.md)

## {category}/{test}/rule.md

The overview of what the rule entails and how to fix it. This is intended to be shown for users when the problem is detected on their page.

Each **README** should contain atleast:

* what the problem is and why it affects users as part of the selected category and test
* how to go about fixing the issue, on various platforms if applicable
* links to more resources if the user is interested

Example [compatibility/html/attribute-not-allowed-on-element-at-this-point.md](https://github.com/passmarked/suite/blob/master/compatibility/html/attribute-not-allowed-on-element-at-this-point.md)
