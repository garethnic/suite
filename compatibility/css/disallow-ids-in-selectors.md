ID selectors are completely unique and therefore cannot be reused.

One of CSS's benefits is the ability to reuse style rules in multiple places. **When you start out with an ID selector, you're automatically limiting that style to a single element.**

Eventually you will end up needing or wanting to reuse the style specified with the ID, and you'll end up defining a class for that purpose. By not using IDs from the start, you allow for the maximum level of reusability with your CSS.
