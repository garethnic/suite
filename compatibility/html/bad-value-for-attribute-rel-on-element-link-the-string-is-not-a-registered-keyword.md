You used a keyword in `rel` that is not recognised. The resource might fail to load correctly.

# How do I fix this ?

Make sure that you haven't misspelled the keyword or use a recognised keyword instead. Currently you can use the following:

* alternate
* author
* help
* icon
* license
* next
* nofollow
* noreferrer
* prefetch
* prev
* search
* stylesheet
* tag
